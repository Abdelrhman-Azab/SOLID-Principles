## GOALS OF USING SOLID PRINCIPLES

Increase the quality of the software by making it

- Robust
- Maintainable
- Usable

## Single Responsibility

A class should have only one reason to change

## Open-Closed

Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open of extension, but closed for modification

## Liskov Substitution

The principle states that objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program. In simpler terms, if a class C is a subclass of class P, an object of class P should be replaceable with an object of class C without affecting the program's functionality.

## Interface Segregation

No code should be forced to depend on methods it does not use.

ISP splits interfaces that are very large into smaller and more specific ones.

## Dependency Inversion

- High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
- Abstractions should not depend on details, Details should depend on abstractions
